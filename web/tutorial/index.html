            <p>
                My reusable component I decided to make consist of tabs in a single web page in which each tab contains a flip card when hovering over the flip card turns to another side.
                My intention of the tabs is to use them as a way of organizing them into certain categories. In my example, I use the tabs to sort them into the various car brands/manufacturers
                The flip card allows the user to present an object they're trying to showcase on the front of the flip card, and when hovering over, it allows them to put further information
                about the showcasing object with ratings other users has put. 
                My MakeCardComponent takes in a few parameters/properties for this component. It takes in a title for the title of the tab, any information regarding the object to be listed 
                on the back of the flip card, an image file for the front of the flip card, and a rating.
